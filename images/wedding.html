There are many beautiful memories that I have and there are so many things I would like to say, however I do not know where to start. Each moment we have shared has been very special, you are my better half and, thanks to you, I discovered how wonderful the feeling of love is. Only you understand me and love me as I am.</p>

            <p class="img-indent-bot">These past four years have been the happiest and fullest of my life. My world is a beautiful place because of you…because of this love that you have given me. Thank you for sharing with me your positive outlook on life.  When I grow panicky and full of anxiety, you calm and soothe me.  When I feel that things are bigger than I am, you are always there, holding my hand, showing me that together we can handle anything in our path. Thank you for remaining endlessly patient with me. I am indeed a work in progress.  I appreciate your ability to look at me and know that although I am imperfect, my strengths outnumber my weaknesses.</p>

I want to make a very special promise to you, I want to tell you that my heart belongs completely to you and that it will be yours today, tomorrow and for ever, and I also want to promise you that my efforts will be focused on making you happy because I want our love to last forever.
